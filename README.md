# A Machine Learning Classification and Exploratory Data Analysis of Breast Cancer
This project was created as part of my MSc degree in Big Data Science 2018-2019.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to visualise a breast cancer dataset and to implement machine learning techniques for classification and prediction of bening and malignant tumours.

### Methods Used
1. Exploratory analysis
  * Violin plots
  * Swarm plots
  * Correlation matrixes
2. Machine learning
  * Naive Bayes
  * KNN
  * SVM

### Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Matplotlib
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-Learn

## Project Description
As almost every woman nowadays is affected by breast cancer, whether by constant worrying about the disease or by diagnosis, this project proposes a study on the said topic. It focuses on the exploratory analysis of the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset for a better understanding of the relationship between the variables, and on the identification of the machine learning algorithms that are best-suited for the problem at hand.

## Data
For this paper, the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data Set is used. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).

2. Raw data is being kept at `data.csv`

3. PDF report can be accessed at `ML_Predicition_Breast_Cancer.pdf`

3. Run `modelling.ipynb` for data exploration and model implementation.
